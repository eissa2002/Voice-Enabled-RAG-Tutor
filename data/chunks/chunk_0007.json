Its artificial neurons may\nrespond to surrounding units within the coverage range. CNN excels at image processing. It includes a\nconvolutional layer, a pooling layer, and a fully connected layer.\n• In the 1960s, Hubel and Wiesel studied cats' cortex neurons used for local sensitivity and direction\nselection and found that their unique network structure could simplify feedback neural networks.\nThey then proposed the CNN.\n• Now, CNN has become one of the research hotspots in many scientific fields, especially in the pattern\nclassification field. The network is widely used because it can avoid complex pre-processing of images\nand directly input original images.",
