This is called transformational invariance.\n◦ Most feature methods are designed to be invariant to\n◦ Translation, 2D rotation, scale\n◦ They can usually also handle\n◦ Limited affine transformations (some are fully affine invariant)\n◦ Limited 3D rotations (SIFT works up to about 60 degrees)\n◦ Limited illumination/contrast changes",
