  "page_content": "Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)\n• Generative Adversarial Network is a unsupervised generative framework that trains generator G and discriminator D through\nthe adversarial process. Through the adversarial process, the discriminator can tell whether the sample from the generator is\nfake or real. GAN adopts a mature BP algorithm.\n• Generator G: The input is noise z, which complies with manually selected prior probability distribution, such as even\ndistribution and Gaussian distribution. The generator adopts the network structure of the multilayer perceptron (MLP), uses",
