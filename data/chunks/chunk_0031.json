The features extracted on the convolutional layer\nand pooling layer are straightened and placed at the fully connected layer to output and classify\nresults.\n• Generally, the Softmax function is used as the activation function of the final fully connected output\nlayer to combine all local features into global features and calculate the score of each type.\nσ(z)𝑗 = 𝑒𝑧𝑗\n 𝑘𝑒𝑧𝑘",
