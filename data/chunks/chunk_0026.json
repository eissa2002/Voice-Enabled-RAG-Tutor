The \noutput of the previous layer (or the original image of the first layer) is used as the input of the current layer. It \nis then convolved with the filter in the layer and serves as the output of this layer. The convolution kernel of \neach layer is the weight to be learned. Similar to FCN, after the convolution is complete, the result should be \nbiased and activated through activation functions before being input to the next layer.\nInput \ntensor\nOutput \ntensor",
