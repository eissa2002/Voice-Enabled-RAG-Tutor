These kinds of features can be \nmatched based on their orientation and local appearance (edge profiles) and can also \nbe good indicators of object boundaries and occlusion events in image sequences.\n◦ Edges can be grouped into longer curves and contours, which can then be tracked.\n◦ They can also be grouped into straight line segments, which can be directly matched or analyzed \nto find vanishing points and hence internal and external camera parameters.",
