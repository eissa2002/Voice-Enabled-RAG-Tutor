Make sure the detector is invariant\n◦ Harris is invariant to translation and rotation\n◦ Scale is trickier\n◦ A common approach is to detect features at many scales using a Gaussian pyramid (e.g., MOPS)\n◦ More sophisticated methods find “the best scale” to represent each feature (e.g., SIFT)\n2. Design an invariant feature descriptor\n◦ A descriptor captures the information in a region around the detected feature point\n◦ The simplest descriptor: a square window of pixels \n◦ What’s this invariant to?",
