Make sure the detector is invariant\n◦ Harris is invariant to translation and rotation\n◦ Scale is trickier\n◦ A common approach is to detect features at many scales using a Gaussian pyramid (e.g., MOPS)\n◦ More sophisticated methods find “the best scale” to represent each feature (e.g., SIFT)\n2. Design an invariant feature descriptor\n◦ A descriptor captures the information in a region around the detected feature point\n◦ The simplest descriptor: a square window of pixels \n◦ What’s this invariant to?\n\nRotational Invariancefor Feature Descriptors\nFind dominant orientation of the image \npatch. This is given by e+, the eigenvector \nof M corresponding to +\nRotate the patch to horizontaldirection\nIntensity normalize the window by \nsubtracting the mean, dividing by the \nstandard deviation in the window\nCSE 576: Computer Vision by Matthew Brown\n8 pixels",
