  "page_content": "Convolutional Neural Network\n• A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a feedforward neural network. Its artificial neurons may\nrespond to surrounding units within the coverage range. CNN excels at image processing. It includes a\nconvolutional layer, a pooling layer, and a fully connected layer.\n• In the 1960s, Hubel and Wiesel studied cats' cortex neurons used for local sensitivity and direction\nselection and found that their unique network structure could simplify feedback neural networks.\nThey then proposed the CNN.",
